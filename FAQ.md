- Q: What is Bloxd Forge?
- A: Bloxd Forge is your one-stop solution to Bloxd gaming.
- Q: Why are there so few features?
- A: There are currently only two active developers, plus it is a passion project, meaning updates will be slow.
- Q: My computer/virus scanning website says it's a virus. What the flip did you do???
- A: We use `pyinstaller` to convert `.py` files into executables (`.exe` files). Most virus detectors flag anything created using `pyinstaller`, which is completely unfair, but we don't have a choice.
- Q: Why does it look so bad/have so many bugs/is so big/feels useless?
- A: As previously stated, this is a passion project. Both developers have a normal life and do not wish to stare at their PC all day(give me a break D:)
- Q: Can I support the developers?
